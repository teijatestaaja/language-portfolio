# Study plan

I wanted to finalize the first version of my study plan as early as possible, so that I would have objectives set for my whole bachelor’s degree already at the beginning of my studies. This would help me in scheduling my studies and organize time available for them during the first year.

## First year

I chose the following courses for the first year:

| Course        | Credits | Type of studies | Study method | Completed |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|----------|-----------|
| Portuguese 1A | 10      | Major | Lecture course | |
| Portuguese 1B | 10      | Major | Lecture course | |
| Portugal’s History and Culture | 5 | Major | Lecture course | |
| Portuguese Phonetics, Phonology and Pronunciation | 5 | Major | Lecture course | |
| Introduction to General Linguistics and Phonetics | 5 | Common | Web course | |
| Introduction to Language Technology | 5 | Common | Web course | |
| Corpus Linguistics and Statistical Methods | 5 | Common | Web course | |
| Academic Reading and Writing Skills | 3 | Common | Book exam | |
| Command Line Tools for Linguists | 5 | Linguistics, Intermediate Studies | Web course | |
| Programming for Linguists  | 5 | Linguistics, Intermediate Studies | Web course | |
| Mathematics for Linguists | 5 | Linguistics, Intermediate Studies | Lecture course | |
| Machine Learning for Linguists | 5 | Linguistics, Intermediate Studies | Lecture course | |
| Orientation Studies | 2 | Other | Web course | |
| Student's Digital Skills: Orientation | 2 | Other | Web course | autumn 2022 |
| Student's Digital Skills: Advanced Skills | 1 | Other | Web course | |
| Total | 73 |  |  | 2 / 73 |

## Minor studies

I chose the basic and advanced studies of Linguistics as well as the module for Translation Studies and Translating for my optional study modules. The reason for these choices is that after the bachelor’s degree I would like to continue my studies further either in the master’s program in Translation and Interpreting (Translation and Interpretation Communication study track), in the master’s program in Linguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities (Language Technology study track) or in the master’s program of Languages (Ibero-Romance Philology study track). Another reason is that I am interested in combining my knowledge of foreign languages with technology and translation, so I believe these optional study modules will be interesting for me also from that perspective.
