# Study plan

I wanted to finalize the first version of my study plan as early as possible, so that I would have objectives set for my whole bachelor’s degree already at the beginning of my studies. This would help me in scheduling my studies and organize time available for them during the first year.

## First year

I chose the following courses for the first year:

| Course        | Credits | Completed |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Portuguese 1A | 10      | |
| Portuguese 1B | 10      | |
| Portugal’s history and culture | 5 | |
| Portuguese phonetics, phonology and pronunciation | 5 | |
| Introduction to General Linguistics and Phonetics | 5 | |
| Introduction to Language Technology | 5 | |
| Corpus Linguistics and Statistical Methods | 5 | |
| Command Line Tools for Linguists | 5 | |
| Programming for Linguists  | 5 | |
| Mathematics for Linguists | 5 | |
| Machine Learning for Linguists | 5 | |
| Orientation Studies | 2 |  |
| Student's digital skills: orientation | 2 | autumn 2022 |
| Student's digital skills: advanced skills | 1 | |
| Total | 70 | 2 / 70 |

## Minor studies

I chose the basic and advanced studies of Linguistics as well as the module for Translation Studies and Translating for my optional study modules. The reason for these choices is that after the bachelor’s degree I would like to continue my studies further either in the master’s program in Translation and Interpreting (Translation and Interpretation Communication study track), in the master’s program in Linguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities (Language Technology study track) or in the master’s program of Languages (Ibero-Romance Philology study track). Another reason is that I am interested in combining my knowledge of foreign languages with technology and translation, so I believe these optional study modules will be interesting for me also from that perspective.
