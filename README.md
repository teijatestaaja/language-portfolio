# Welcome - Bem-vindo!

This is a language portfolio for my BachelorÂ´s degree studies at the University of Helsinki. I started my studies in September 2022, as I finally got in to study Portuguese as my major on the third attempt at the entrance exam. I was lucky to finally being able to study a new Romance language, as I have previously studied only Spanish at the university level.

The purpose of this portfolio is to act as a sample portfolio, which means that it contains thoughtfully created selection of documents related to my studies. This should hopefully help me in the construction of my own career path as well as in supporting the development of my language expert identity.

The portfolio is divided in four parts:

- academic performances (projects, essays etc.) I consider important
- my goals for each study year and analysis on how they were achieved
- SWOT analysis
- roadmap of my studies
