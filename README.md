# Bem-vindo!

This is a language portfolio for my Portuguese language studies at the University of Helsinki. I started my studies in September 2022, as I finally got in to study Portuguese as my major on a third attempt at the entrance exam. I was so lucky to finally being able to study a new Romance language. I am currently studying while working full time as a Test Automation Engineer.
